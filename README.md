# Global Storybooks Translation Guidelines

This page contains guidelines and detailed information for translators who are translating stories as part of the [Global Storybooks](https://globalstorybooks.net) literacy portal.

Each of the regional or theme-based Storybooks websites on the portal is based around a curated collection of 40 stories from the [African Storybook](https://africanstorybook.org) which have been translated into the most widely spoken languages the region. The complete list of 40 stories can be found [below](#stories).

## Translator app

To be included in the project, all translations must be submitted through our online app for translators, which can be found here:

https://globalstorybooks.net/translator/

Click the _Translate!_ button to begin. There is inline help available from within the app (click on _Help_ or _About_ in the menu at the top of the page).

Note that although by default the shortest stories are presented first in the app you do not have to translate the stories in the order they appear. You can translate them in any order you prefer, or even randomly by clicking the "random story" button in the translator app. The app will keep track of your progress and let you know when you come to a story that has already been completed.

Once you are finished translating a story, click on the _Review submission_ button at the bottom of the page to check your translation. If there are any changes you would like to make you can close the review window and return later. When you are happy with your translation, click on the _Submit translation_ button in the review window and your translation will be submitted directly to the project. Shortly afterwards, you should be able to see your translation online on [your local storybooks website](https://globalstorybooks.net).

## General guidelines

* Style: As these are children's stories, please keep the vocabulary level and style appropriate for the audience.
* Images: Each segment of text has a corresponding image, which is displayed to the left of the text in the translator app. You can click on the image to see it enlarged. If the text is unclear, it may be helpful to refer to the accompanying image.
* Proper names: As a general rule, proper names (e.g., _Anansi_, _Simbegwire_, _Cissy_, etc.) should not be "translated", but rather adapted to your language as you see fit. Detailed guidance on handling proper nouns as well as a [complete list of names](#list-of-proper-names) used in the stories can be found below in the section on [proper nouns](#proper-nouns) for reference.
* Vocabulary: There are a number of terms in the text that deserve special attention when translating. A detailed list of the most common questions and vocabulary issues can be found in [the list of stories below](#stories).

## Proper nouns

### Names

Please avoid changing the names of the characters (e.g., "Simbegwire", "Odongo") in the stories as much as possible. This particularly applies to languages with Latin character-based orthographies. More specific guidelines and instructions are below.

For example, the name _Themba_ should not be changed to "Thomas" (e.g., in French or German) in an attempt to "localize" it for a domestic audience. Likewise, _Khalai_ should not be "translated" to "Keiko" in Japanese, but rather **transliterated** as accurately as possible in accordance with local conventions.

#### Translation strategies for proper names

There are several approaches available for handling proper names in different languages. They are listed below:

* **Transliteration**: Here the pronunciation of the name is approximated using the target language orthography. This is the normal approach for languages that do not use the Latin alphabet or a variant thereof. The audio of the original story can be consulted as a reference pronunciation.
  * For example: _Khalai_ has been [transliterated into Japanese](https://global-asp.github.io/storybooks-japan/stories/ja/0089/) as **カライ** (_karai_), [into Mandarin](https://storybookscanada.ca/stories/zh/0089/) as **卡莱** (_kãlái_), and [into Arabic](https://storybookscanada.ca/stories/ar/0089/) as **خلاي** (_ḵalāyi_).
* **Foreignization**: Here the name is left in its original form, without modifications. This is the default approach for Latin-based orthographies (with some exceptions, see _adaptation_ below).
  * For example: The name _Magozwe_ is spelled **Magozwe** in English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Polish (among others).
  * Note: Grammatical affixes (e.g., representing case) should be used as normal, even if they change the spelling of the name -- for example, **Magozwe's** (English: genitive case), **Magozwes** (German: genitive case), **Magozwe’ye** (Turkish: dative case), **Magozwe-nak** (Hungarian, dative case), **Thomasem** (Polish: instrumental case) etc.
* **Adaptation**: In this case, the spelling of the word is adjusted so that the pronunciation more closely matches the originial when read out loud in the target language. This approach is usually used when keeping the original spelling would result in a drastically different or otherwise unpleasant pronunciation by readers in the target language, or if it is conventional in a particular language community to respell foreign language words.
  * For example: _Andiswa_ is still spelled **Andiswa** in Jamaican Creole, however _Tingi_ has been changed to **Tinggi** to avoid the incorrect pronunciation /tiŋi/ and _Tom_ has been changed to **Taam** to reflect the conventional pronunciation of the name as /taːm/.

#### Pronunciation of proper names

Of course, the _pronunciation_ of proper names in the audio recording may (and should) follow the regular conventions and phonotactics of the language in question. There is a certain amount of leeway in this which is left up to the reader doing the recording.

For example, the name _Juma_ /dʒuma/ occurs in the story [Decision](https://storybookscanada.ca/stories/en/0027/). Since the sound /dʒ/ is not common in some languages, there are a number of ways that this could be pronounced. In French, the reader chose to pronounce this as /ʒuma/, while in German, Norwegian, and Polish it was pronounced /juma/, and in Spanish /xuma/, in accordance with the conventions of those languages. On the other hand, in Turkish, the reader preferred to keep the original pronunciation as /dʒuma/, rather than /ʒuma/ which would also have been acceptable.

#### List of proper names

Below is a list of the proper names included in the corpus. Because grammatical gender is significant in many languages and may affect translation, the gender of each character is listed as well for reference.
